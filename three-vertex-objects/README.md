# three-vertex-objects

is a typescript library for creating realtime 2.5D graphics in HTML5

it's based on the fantastic [three.js](https://threejs.org/) library which itself is build upon WebGL

the core features of this library are centered around the definition, creation and life-cycle management of _vertex objects_

## Vertex Objects

are like freestyle [sprites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)) whose attributes, vertex and fragment shaders are completely freely definable &mdash; but the management and organization of internal geometry data attribute arrays is taken away from you
