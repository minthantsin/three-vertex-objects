# three-vertex-objects

is a typescript library for creating realtime 2.5D graphics in HTML5

it's based on the fantastic [three.js](https://threejs.org/) library which itself is build upon WebGL

the main features of this library are centered around the definition, creation and life-cycle management of _vertex objects_

## Vertex Objects

are like freestyle [sprites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)) whose attributes, vertex and fragment shaders are completely freely definable &mdash; but the management and organization of the underlying geometry data attribute arrays is taken away from you

## Texture Mapping

those who work with sprites will quickly realize that an easy way to import [spritesheet images and texture-atlas definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_atlas) could be very handy.
this library provides helpers for importing tilesets via grid-aligned spritesheet images or texture altases from json files (generated by tools such as [TexturePacker](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker)).

## Projection

the projection simplifies the use of a [THREE.Camera](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/cameras/Camera) in a two dimensional responsive design aware pixelart context. you always wanted to have a perspective camera that can display a resolution of 640x480 in the canvas, respecting the ["object-fit: contain"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) rules within the viewport, ideally with the origin in the upper right corner? then you should try the [ParallaxProjection](./src/ParallaxProjection.ts) or the [OrthographicProjection](./sr/../src/OrthographicProjection.ts).
